    In this section there is another continer which contains a pair of containers, one container of the main file and one contianer
    of the referecne file.

    We associate these two to find a match between them. So for every string entry of the reference container the main container is checked
    for matches. If a match is found between the strings then the time value (integer entry) of the refernce is subtracted from
    the corresponding main value (integer entry). The value is written to a file named offset.

    For example

       Reference container           Main Container
       -----------------            ----------------
        154781 | 10               215487101 | 49
        123654 | 11               123654    | 50
      65214782 | 12                    .    |
      854120023| 13                    .    |
                                       .    |
                                 854120023  | 86


  We have 2 matches from the table. The first match is 123645 so the difference of the corresponding time values i.e 50-11 = 39 is written to offset
 again the difference of the time values of the second match 854120023, which is 86-13 = 73 is written to the offset file.

 This way all the matches and all their corresponding time differences are recorded

    Finally the delay is calculated and the integer is converted back to string
    Where did the 0.02323... number come from ???

    here is the secret behind that number

    our WAV file is sampled at 44100 samples per second and it is encoded with 2 bytes so that gives us 44100*2 = 88200 bytes/sec
    In simple terms we have 88200 bytes of data in one second. We are working with a chunk which is 2048 bytes.
    So what is the duration of a 2048 bytes of data ?

    it would be 2048/88200 = 0.023219955 sec

    If our most_occuring function returns a value of 1000, it means the delay between the main file and the reference file is 1000
    chunks or reference file is a snippet of the main file after 1000 chunks. In terms of time it means the reference file matches
    the main file after 1000*0.023219955 = 23.219 seconds.
